acts_as_tree
============

This derivative of rails/acts_as_tree allows leaves and nodes to be differentiated classes. It is also very, very alpha.

You should also be able to use regular acts_as_tree if you include this plugin, though I haven't tested it. No functionality was removed. (The `children` method might cause a problem.)

Instead of specifying acts_as_tree, you'll do it a little differently.

  class Tree < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Nothing here, just a base class (never instantiate it)
  end
  
  class Node < Tree
    acts_as_tree_node :node_class_name => 'NodeMatrix', :leaf_class_name => 'LeafMatrix', :order => "name"
  end
  
  class Leaf < Tree
    acts_as_tree_leaf :node_class_name => 'NodeMatrix'
  end

You can also access specifically node children or leaf children using the functions `child_leaves` and `child_nodes`.

I strongly suggest reading the RDoc for more details.
